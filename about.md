BIAS Journal of Physics is a peer-reviewed, Open Access journal that publishes the results of theoretical and experimental research on the physics. 


General information for preparing manuscripts:

Manuscripts should be prepared for online submission. Online submissions include a manuscript text file, individual figure files and optional Supplementary Information files. For first submissions, authors may choose to incorporate the manuscript text and figures into a single file (Microsoft Word, TeX/LaTeX or PDF). 

The preferred editable format is LaTeX, using the REVTeX 4.1 style.

In this journal, the focus will be on insights and enigmas of the physics.

Research and review papers written not only by experts, but also by young researchers are welcome.
